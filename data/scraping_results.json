Here's a brief summary:\n\n* The document content is a revised version of MAS Notice 626, last revised on 30 June 2025, which supersedes the previous version.\n* The revised notice includes updated definitions, such as the inclusion of \"proliferation financing\" in the definition of \"money laundering\".\n* The notice also provides new definitions for terms like \"beneficial owner\", \"beneficiary institution\", and \"business relations\".\n* The regulatory section on Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is not directly mentioned in the provided document content, but it is likely that the revised notice includes updates to the CDD requirements.\n\nOverall, the updates appear to be focused on clarifying definitions and providing more specific guidance on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements for banks in Singapore."
