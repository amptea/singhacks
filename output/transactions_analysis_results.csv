Medium,55,"['KYC Not Updated', 'Ongoing Monitoring Violation']","The transaction is high‑value (S$1.3m) but the customer’s KYC was last completed on 25/12/2021, well beyond the due date of 23/06/2022, indicating a lapse in ongoing monitoring and risk assessment. No other clauses (CDD, sanctions, travel rule, value transfer, or suspicious activity) are violated.",135cef35-c054-46f0-8d8d-daedb7429de4,0
Medium,55,"['KYC Outdated', 'Potential Sanctions Hit']","The transaction meets most AML/CFT requirements: appropriate CDD, EDD, travel‑rule compliance, and no structuring. However, the customer’s KYC was last completed on 20/10/2023, which is more than 12 months before the booking date (03/12/2024), exceeding the acceptable period for a low‑risk customer. Additionally, sanctions screening returned a potential hit, indicating a possible sanctions violation that warrants heightened scrutiny. No other rule violations were identified, so the overall risk is assessed as medium.",66f1c2c5-6585-40e9-9b9d-4ec10c6fdbae,1
Medium,65,"['value_transfers.clause_11A - Missing va_disclosure_provided', 'value_transfers.clause_11A - Missing Additional Originator Info for >S$1,500']","The transaction is a high‑value digital token transfer (product_has_va_exposure=true). Clause 11A requires a value‑transfer disclosure and, for amounts exceeding S$1,500, additional originator details (address, ID or date/place of birth). Both are missing, constituting two violations of the Travel Rule for value transfers. No other major AML/CFT breaches are evident, so the risk is assessed as Medium.",15ce0bc5-e37b-4279-90ee-e5d289713d46,2
Medium,55,['EDD Required for High Risk Jurisdiction'],"The transaction involves a high‑risk jurisdiction (Russia) and a medium‑risk customer, yet the risk assessment indicates that Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) was not required (edd_required=false). Under MAS Notice 626, high‑risk jurisdictions mandate EDD, so this is a compliance violation. No other clauses (e.g., sanctions screening, travel rule, or suspicious activity) are breached. The single violation places the transaction in the medium‑risk category with a score of 55.",e8db37cf-2a87-404b-af55-bc48ed06a1e1,3
Low,20,[],"All applicable AML/CFT controls are satisfied: the transaction is a cross‑border FX conversion involving a high‑risk PEP customer, but enhanced due diligence (EDD) and source‑of‑wealth documentation have been completed. The Travel Rule for wire transfers is fully met (originator/beneficiary details, SWIFT tags, and travel_rule_complete flag are present). No sanctions hit, no suspicion flag, and record‑keeping requirements are met. Therefore no rule violations are identified, resulting in a low‑risk assessment.",015e2202-1c97-4f0f-9756-2c8fc85e7ac9,4
