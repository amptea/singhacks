Medium,55,"['High Transaction Amount', 'KYC Outdated']","The transaction is a high‑value cross‑border wire transfer (over S$20,000) and the KYC record is more than 12 months old, violating the requirement that KYC be recent for such transactions. No other rule violations were detected, so the risk is assessed as medium.",135cef35-c054-46f0-8d8d-daedb7429de4,0
Low,20,[],"All required CDD, EDD, sanctions screening, travel rule, and record‑keeping obligations have been satisfied. The transaction is a high‑value cross‑border FX conversion for a low‑risk PEP customer with up‑to‑date KYC and no suspicion flags.

High,85,"['Value Transfer Disclosure (va_disclosure_provided)', 'Missing Originator Address/ID (11A.6-11A.8)', 'Immediate Secure Submission (11A.9)', 'Immediate Secure Submission to Next Intermediary (11A.17)']","The transaction involves a digital token transfer (product_has_va_exposure=true) exceeding S$1,500. While the travel rule is marked complete, key requirements for value transfers are not met: the disclosure of virtual asset information is missing, originator address/ID details are absent, and the mandatory immediate secure submission to the beneficiary and next intermediary is not documented. These violations trigger multiple clauses of Notice 626, indicating a high risk of non‑compliance and potential money‑laundering facilitation.",15ce0bc5-e37b-4279-90ee-e5d289713d46,2
Medium,55,"['Risk Assessment EDD Required', 'New Product Risk Assessment Missing']","The transaction involves a high‑risk jurisdiction (Russia) and a medium‑risk customer, yet the risk assessment indicates that enhanced due diligence (EDD) was not required (edd_required=false) despite the high‑risk country, constituting a violation of Clause 4. Additionally, the product is marked as complex (product_complex=true) but there is no evidence of a prior risk assessment for the new product, violating Clause 5. No other AML/CFT clauses are breached, so the overall risk is assessed as medium.",e8db37cf-2a87-404b-af55-bc48ed06a1e1,3
Medium,55,"['Potential Sanctions Hit', 'Suspicious Transaction Reporting Not Filed']","The transaction involves a high‑risk PEP customer and a potential sanctions screening hit.
