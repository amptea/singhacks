Low,20,[],"The transaction satisfies all relevant MAS Notice 626 requirements: cross‑border SWIFT transfer with travel rule completed, appropriate CDD performed, no sanctions hits, no PEP, and no suspicious activity flagged. No rule violations were identified, resulting in a low‑risk assessment.",135cef35-c054-46f0-8d8d-daedb7429de4,0
High,85,"['Potential Sanctions Screening', 'Suspicion of ML/TF', 'Failure to File STR']","The transaction involved a PEP and a high value amount (~S$300k). Sanctions screening flagged a potential hit, yet the bank proceeded with the transfer and did not file a suspicious transaction report, violating clauses 6.2, 6.39‑6.42 and 14. This constitutes a significant AML compliance breach, warranting a high risk assessment.",66f1c2c5-6585-40e9-9b9d-4ec10c6fdbae,1
High,85,"['Value Transfer Disclosure Missing', 'Missing Originator Identification for Value Transfer', 'Sanctions Screening Not Performed', 'Outdated KYC for Digital Token Transaction']","The transaction is a digital token transfer (product_has_va_exposure=true) with a high value (S$1,991,250.25). It fails several mandatory requirements: the value transfer disclosure (va_disclosure_provided) is false, originator identification details (address/ID) are missing for a >S$1,500 transfer, sanctions screening results are not populated, and the KYC was last completed over a year ago, violating ongoing monitoring obligations. These multiple breaches trigger a high‑risk assessment.",15ce0bc5-e37b-4279-90ee-e5d289713d46,2
High,85,"['Clause 6.2 - Reasonable Grounds for Suspicion (potential sanctions hit and missing suspicion determination date)', 'Clause 14 - Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR not filed despite potential sanctions hit)', 'Clause 6.39-6.42 - Screening (sanctions screening flagged potential hit but no STR filed)']","The transaction is a large cross‑border fund subscription from a Russian domiciliary company, with a potential sanctions hit flagged in the screening. The bank proceeded with the transaction without recording a suspicion determination date and failed to file a suspicious transaction report, violating the requirements of Clause 6.2 and Clause 14. Additionally, the sanctions screening result indicates a potential hit, which under Clause 6.39‑6.42 requires further action. These violations, combined with the high transaction amount and high‑risk jurisdiction, classify the transaction as high risk.",e8db37cf-2a87-404b-af55-bc48ed06a1e1,3
