    "Potential Sanctions Hit",
    "High Daily Cash Total for Customer"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction triggers a potential sanctions hit and the customer\u2019s daily cash total exceeds the $10,000 threshold, indicating possible structuring. However, the amount is modest, the customer risk rating is low, and no other red\u2011flag rules are triggered, so the overall risk is assessed as medium."
