  "matched_rules": [
    "High Transaction Amount"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction amount of 155,364.83 CNY exceeds the high transaction threshold (>17,343.58), triggering the \"High Transaction Amount\" rule. However, the customer has a medium risk rating, no sanctions hit, no EDD gap, daily cash total is zero, and travel rule information is complete. These mitigating factors reduce the overall risk, resulting in a medium risk assessment with a score of 65."
