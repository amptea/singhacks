  "explanation": "The transaction involves a beneficiary in Iran, a FATF counter\u2011measure jurisdiction, yet the risk assessment rates the customer as Medium and EDD is marked as not required. This violates Clause\u202f4 and Clause\u202f8 requirements for high\u2011risk customers. Additionally, sanctions screening returned a potential hit but no suspicious transaction report was filed, breaching Clause\u202f6.2 and Clause\u202f14. These multiple breaches warrant a high\u2011risk classification.",
