  "explanation": "The cash deposit of S$5,562.81 from a medium\u2011risk corporate customer (originator TH, beneficiary IR) falls below the S$20,000 CDD trigger and is not a digital\u2011token transaction. EDD was performed as required, sanctions screening returned a potential match but not a confirmed hit, and no suspicion flag or STR was triggered. All relevant clauses (risk assessment, CDD, simplified CDD, sanctions screening, record\u2011keeping) are satisfied, so no violations are identified.",
