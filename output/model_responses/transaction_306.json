  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. Although the customer is rated low risk and no daily cash structuring or EDD gaps are present, the combination of a large value and sanctions concern warrants a high risk assessment."
