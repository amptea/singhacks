  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction amount ($1,147,587.97) exceeds the high transaction threshold, triggering the \"High Transaction Amount\" rule. No other red\u2011flag conditions (sanctions hit, EDD gap, daily cash structuring, or incomplete travel rule data) are present, and the customer risk rating is medium. Therefore the transaction is considered medium risk for money laundering."
