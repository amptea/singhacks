  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the S$20,000 threshold for a non\u2011relationship customer, yet the KYC was last completed over three years ago and the due date has passed, indicating a lapse in ongoing monitoring. The sanctions screening returned a potential hit, raising concern. No direct violation of travel\u2011rule or value\u2011transfer requirements was found, but the outdated KYC and potential sanctions flag elevate the risk to medium.",
