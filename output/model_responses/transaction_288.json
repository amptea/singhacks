  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. Despite a low customer risk rating and no daily cash structuring, the combination of a large value and sanctions screening concern warrants a high\u2011risk assessment."
