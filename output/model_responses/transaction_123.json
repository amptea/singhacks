  "explanation": "The transaction amount of USD 1,814,421.34 exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold, triggering the \"High Transaction Amount\" rule. However, the customer has a low risk rating, no sanctions hit, no EDD requirement, and the daily cash total is zero, which mitigates the overall risk. Consequently, the transaction is assessed as medium risk."
