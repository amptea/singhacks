  "risk_label": "Medium",

  "matched_rules": [
    "High Transaction Amount",
    "Incomplete Travel Rule Information"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and lacks complete travel rule data, both of which are red flags. However, the customer has a low risk rating, no sanctions hit, and no EDD gap, which mitigates the overall risk. Therefore, the transaction is assessed as medium risk."
