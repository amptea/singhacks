    "High Transaction Amount"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction amount of 940,683.80 SGD exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold, triggering the \"High Transaction Amount\" rule. However, the customer has a low risk rating, no sanctions hit, EDD is not required, daily cash total is zero, and travel rule data is complete. These mitigating factors reduce the overall risk, resulting in a medium risk assessment with a score of 70."
