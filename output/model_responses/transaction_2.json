  "explanation": "The transaction is a high\u2011value digital token transfer (product_has_va_exposure=true). Clause 11A requires a value\u2011transfer disclosure and, for amounts exceeding S$1,500, additional originator details (address, ID or date/place of birth). Both are missing, constituting two violations of the Travel Rule for value transfers. No other major AML/CFT breaches are evident, so the risk is assessed as Medium.",
