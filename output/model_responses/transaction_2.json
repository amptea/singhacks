  "explanation": "The transaction is a digital token transfer (product_has_va_exposure=true) with a high value (S$1,991,250.25). It fails several mandatory requirements: the value transfer disclosure (va_disclosure_provided) is false, originator identification details (address/ID) are missing for a >S$1,500 transfer, sanctions screening results are not populated, and the KYC was last completed over a year ago, violating ongoing monitoring obligations. These multiple breaches trigger a high‑risk assessment.",
