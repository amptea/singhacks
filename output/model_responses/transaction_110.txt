{"risk_label":"Medium","score":65,"matched_rules":["High Transaction Amount"],"explanation":"The transaction exceeds the high‑amount threshold (HKD 29,945.07 > HKD 17,343.58), which is a key indicator of suspicious activity. However, other red‑flags such as sanctions hits, daily cash structuring, or incomplete travel‑rule data are absent, and enhanced due diligence was performed. Consequently, the transaction is assessed as medium risk."
