    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction triggered a potential sanctions hit, which is a notable red flag. However, the amount is below the high\u2011transaction threshold, the customer has a low risk rating, no EDD gap exists, daily cash totals are negligible, and travel\u2011rule information is complete. These mitigating factors suggest a moderate risk rather than a high\u2011risk money\u2011laundering scenario."
