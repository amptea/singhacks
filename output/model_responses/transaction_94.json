  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction triggered a potential sanctions screening hit, which is a significant red flag. However, the amount is below the high\u2011transaction threshold, the customer has a low risk rating, and no EDD gap or daily cash structuring is present. These mitigating factors suggest a medium risk level rather than high."
