  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. Other controls (travel rule complete, no EDD gap, low daily cash total) mitigate but do not eliminate the risk, leading to a high risk assessment."
