  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. Other mitigating factors (low customer risk rating, complete travel rule data, no daily cash structuring) do not offset these red flags, leading to a high risk assessment."
