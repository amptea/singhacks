    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction triggered a potential sanctions hit, which is a significant red flag. However, the amount is low, the customer has a low risk rating, no EDD gap, and daily cash totals are well below structuring thresholds. These mitigating factors suggest a moderate overall risk rather than a high one."
