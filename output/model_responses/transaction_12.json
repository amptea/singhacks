  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the S$20,000 threshold for a non-relationship customer, but the customer\u2019s KYC was last completed almost three years ago and is overdue, violating the ongoing monitoring and CDD requirements. Additionally, the cross\u2011border wire transfer lacks the mandatory originator address/ID information required for amounts above S$1,500, breaching the Travel Rule provisions. These multiple compliance gaps elevate the risk to high.",
