  "explanation": "The transaction is a high\u2011value cash withdrawal (S$23,862.98) from a high\u2011risk customer (originator country Russia, high risk rating). While enhanced due diligence (EDD) was performed, the sanctions screening returned a potential hit and no suspicion flag or STR was filed, violating clause\u202f6.2 and the STR obligations. Additionally, simplified CDD was applied to a high\u2011risk customer, breaching clause\u202f7.4. These compliance breaches elevate the risk to a high level.",
