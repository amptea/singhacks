    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction triggered a potential sanctions hit, which is a significant red flag. However, the transaction amount is low, the customer has a low risk rating, daily cash totals are below structuring thresholds, and all other controls (travel rule, EDD, KYC) are satisfied. Therefore the overall risk is assessed as medium."
