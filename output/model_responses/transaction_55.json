  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. No daily structuring or EDD gaps are present, but the combination of a large value and sanctions concern warrants a high\u2011risk classification."
