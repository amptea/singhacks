  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction triggers two significant AML indicators: the customer is rated as 'High' risk and the daily cash total exceeds the $10,000 threshold, suggesting potential structuring. However, the transaction amount is below the high-amount threshold, sanctions screening is clear, and EDD was performed, mitigating some risk. Overall, the transaction presents a moderate money\u2011laundering risk."
