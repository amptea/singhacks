  "risk_label": "Medium",
  "score": 70,
  "matched_rules": [
    "High Transaction Amount",
    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both strong indicators of suspicious activity. However, the customer is rated low risk, no EDD gap, and no daily structuring pattern, so the overall risk is assessed as medium rather than high."
