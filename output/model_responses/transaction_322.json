  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and involves a customer with a high risk rating, both strong indicators of potential money\u2011laundering activity. No sanctions hit or daily cash structuring issues were identified, and EDD was performed, but the combination of a large amount and high\u2011risk customer warrants a high risk assessment."
