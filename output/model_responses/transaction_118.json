  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction amount (74,270.35 JPY) exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold, triggering the \"High Transaction Amount\" rule. However, the customer has a low risk rating, no sanctions hit, no EDD gap, daily cash total is zero, and travel\u2011rule data is complete. These mitigating factors reduce the overall risk, resulting in a medium risk assessment."
