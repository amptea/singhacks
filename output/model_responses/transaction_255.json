  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction amount (CHF 1,011,625.96) exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold, triggering the \"High Transaction Amount\" rule. No other red\u2011flag rules are triggered: the customer risk rating is medium, there is no sanctions hit, EDD is not required, daily cash total is zero, and travel rule data is complete. The single trigger suggests a moderate risk of money laundering, warranting further review."
