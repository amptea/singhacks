  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. Other mitigating factors (medium customer risk, no EDD gap, low daily cash total, complete travel rule data) reduce but do not eliminate the risk, leading to a high overall assessment."
