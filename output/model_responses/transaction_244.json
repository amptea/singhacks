  "explanation": "The transaction involves a customer with a high risk rating and triggered a potential sanctions hit, which are significant red flags. However, the transaction amount is below the high-amount threshold, there is no daily cash structuring indicator, and EDD was performed. These factors moderate the overall risk to a medium level."
