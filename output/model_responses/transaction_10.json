  "explanation": "The transaction is a cross\u2011border wire transfer of S$307,132.95 (CHF 307,132.95) which exceeds the S$1,500 threshold for the Travel Rule. The record shows travel_rule_complete=false and no originator residential address or ID, violating clause\u202f11 requirements. Additionally, the customer\u2019s KYC was last completed on 28/12/2020, with a due date of 28/12/2022, meaning the CDD is overdue for a non\u2011relationship customer, violating clause\u202f6.19\u20116.26. These regulatory breaches elevate the transaction to a medium risk level. No PEP or sanctions hits were identified, and the transaction otherwise meets other CDD and screening obligations.",
