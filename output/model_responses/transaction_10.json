  "explanation": "The transaction is a high\u2011value domestic wire transfer between individuals in Vietnam. The bank has performed CDD and EDD, and all required information for the wire transfer is present. However, the KYC data for the customer is overdue (last completed 28/12/2020, due 28/12/2022), which violates the ongoing monitoring requirement of Clause\u202f6.19\u20116.26. No other rule violations were detected, so the overall risk is assessed as Medium.",
