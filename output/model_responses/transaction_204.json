  "explanation": "The transaction amount of 247,881.78 GBP exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold (17,343.58 GBP) and is characteristic of suspected money\u2011laundering activity. No other AML rules are triggered, but the originator is a PEP, which adds additional risk. Overall, the transaction is considered high risk."
