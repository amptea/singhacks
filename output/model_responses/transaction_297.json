  "explanation": "The transaction triggered a potential sanctions hit, which is a significant red flag. However, the amount is below the high-transaction threshold, the customer has a low risk rating, no EDD gap, and no daily cash structuring concerns. These mitigating factors suggest a medium risk level rather than high."
