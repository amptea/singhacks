  "explanation": "The transaction amount of CHF 1,894,021.93 exceeds the high transaction threshold of 17,343.58, triggering the \"High Transaction Amount\" rule. No other AML rules are triggered, but the large value alone constitutes a significant risk indicator, warranting a high risk label and a score of 85."
