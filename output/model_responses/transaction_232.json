  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and involves a customer with a high risk rating, both strong indicators of potential money\u2011laundering activity. Although enhanced due diligence was performed, sanctions screening returned no hits and daily cash totals are low, the combination of a large value and high\u2011risk customer warrants a high risk assessment."
