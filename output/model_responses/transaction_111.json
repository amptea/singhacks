  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. No other mitigating factors (e.g., low customer risk rating, completed EDD, or travel\u2011rule compliance) are present, so the transaction is classified as high risk."
