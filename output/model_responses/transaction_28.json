  "explanation": "The transaction triggered a potential sanctions hit and exceeded the daily cash threshold, indicating possible structuring. Although the amount is below the high\u2011transaction threshold and the customer risk rating is low, the customer is a PEP and the sanctions potential raises concern. Combined, these factors warrant a medium risk assessment."
