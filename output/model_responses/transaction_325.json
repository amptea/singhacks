    "High Transaction Amount",
    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both of which are strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. However, the customer has a low risk rating, no daily cash structuring, and all other controls (EDD, travel rule, KYC) are satisfied, which mitigates the risk. Overall, the transaction is assessed as medium risk."
