  "explanation": "The transaction triggers several compliance gaps: KYC was recorded after the booking date and the KYC due date precedes the last completed KYC, violating the timing requirements of Clause\u202f6.3 and Clause\u202f6.19. Additionally, for a PEP the Enhanced CDD (Clause\u202f8) requires documented source of wealth and funds, which is not present. These issues elevate the risk to a medium level.",
