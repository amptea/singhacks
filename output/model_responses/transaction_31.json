    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction triggered a potential sanctions hit, which is a significant red flag. However, the amount is below the high\u2011transaction threshold, the customer risk rating is medium, daily cash totals are within limits, and all other controls (EDD, travel rule, etc.) are satisfied. Therefore the overall risk is assessed as medium."
