  "risk_label": "Medium",
  "score": 70,
  "matched_rules": [
    "High Transaction Amount",
    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both of which are significant red flags. However, the customer has a low risk rating, no daily cash structuring, and no EDD gap, mitigating the overall risk. Thus the transaction is assessed as medium risk."
