    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction triggered a potential sanctions screening hit, which is a notable red flag. However, the amount is below the high-transaction threshold, the customer has a low risk rating, no EDD gap, daily cash total is negligible, and travel rule data is complete. These mitigating factors suggest a medium risk level rather than high."
