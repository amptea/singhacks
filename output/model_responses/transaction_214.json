    "High Transaction Amount",

  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high amount threshold, involves a high\u2011risk customer, and triggered a potential sanctions hit, all of which are strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. No EDD gap or daily cash structuring issues were present, but the combination of the three active rules warrants a high\u2011risk classification."
