  "risk_label": "Medium",
  "score": 60,
  "matched_rules": [
    "High Transaction Amount"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high amount threshold, which is a common indicator of suspicious activity. However, other risk factors such as customer risk rating, sanctions screening, EDD requirements, daily cash totals, and travel rule completeness are all within normal limits, reducing the overall risk profile. Therefore, the transaction is assessed as medium risk."
