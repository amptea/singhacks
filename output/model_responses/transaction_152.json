  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both of which are strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. Other mitigating factors (low customer risk rating, completed travel rule, no daily cash structuring) are present, but the combination of a large amount and sanctions concern warrants a high risk assessment."
