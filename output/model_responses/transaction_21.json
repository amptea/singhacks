  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and the required EDD was not performed, indicating a control failure. Although the customer risk rating is low and there are no sanctions or travel\u2011rule issues, the combination of a large amount and missing due diligence raises the likelihood of money\u2011laundering activity to a high level."
