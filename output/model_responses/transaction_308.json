    "High Transaction Amount",

  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both of which are significant red flags. However, the customer is rated low risk, no EDD gap, and the daily cash total is negligible, mitigating some risk. Overall, the combination of a large amount and sanctions potential warrants a medium risk assessment."
