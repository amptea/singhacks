    "Potential Sanctions Hit",
    "High Daily Cash Total for Customer"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction triggers a potential sanctions hit and the customer\u2019s daily cash total exceeds the $10,000 threshold, indicating possible structuring and sanctions risk. However, the transaction amount is moderate, the customer risk rating is low, and no EDD gap exists, so the overall risk is assessed as medium."
