  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction amount of CHF 213,232.75 exceeds the high transaction threshold, triggering the \"High Transaction Amount\" rule. However, the customer has a low risk rating, no sanctions hit, EDD is not required, daily cash total is negligible, and travel rule data is complete. These mitigating factors reduce the overall risk, resulting in a medium risk assessment."
