    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction triggered a potential sanctions screening hit, which is a significant red flag. However, the amount is below the high-transaction threshold, the customer has a low risk rating, no EDD gap, daily cash total is negligible, and travel rule information is complete. These mitigating factors reduce the overall risk, resulting in a medium risk assessment."
