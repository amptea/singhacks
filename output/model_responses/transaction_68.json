    "High Transaction Amount",
    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both of which are strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. However, the customer has a low risk rating, no daily cash structuring, and the travel rule information is complete, mitigating some risk. Overall, the transaction is assessed as medium risk with a score of 70."
