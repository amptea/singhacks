  "explanation": "The transaction involves a high\u2011risk customer and a large amount, yet the KYC was last completed over two years ago and the ongoing monitoring due date has passed, violating the CDD and monitoring requirements of clauses 6.3 and 6.19\u20116.26. No other rule violations were detected, so the overall risk is assessed as medium.",
