  "explanation": "The transaction amount (SGD 217,902.88) is well above the high\u2011amount threshold and it triggered a potential sanctions hit during screening. These two factors strongly suggest a money\u2011laundering risk, outweighing the mitigating factors such as a medium customer risk rating and complete travel rule information."
