  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. Other mitigating factors (low customer risk rating, no daily cash structuring, complete travel rule data) do not offset these red flags, leading to a high\u2011risk assessment."
