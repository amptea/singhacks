  "explanation": "The transaction amount of CHF 20,000 exceeds the high transaction threshold, triggering the \"High Transaction Amount\" rule. However, the customer has a low risk rating, no sanctions hit, no EDD requirement, and the daily cash total is negligible. These mitigating factors suggest a moderate risk rather than a high one."
