  "explanation": "The wire transfer exceeds the S$20,000 threshold for non\u2011relationship customers, yet the KYC was last completed over a year ago, violating the requirement for recent CDD. Additionally, sanctions screening returned a potential hit, but no suspicious transaction report was filed, breaching the sanctions screening and STR obligations under MAS Notice 626. These infractions elevate the risk to a medium level.",
