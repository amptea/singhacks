    "High Transaction Amount",
    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both of which are strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. However, the customer is rated low risk, has no daily cash structuring, and all other controls (EDD, travel rule, etc.) are satisfied, so the overall risk is assessed as medium rather than high."
