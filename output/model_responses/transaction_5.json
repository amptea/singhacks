  "explanation": "The transaction involves a high\u2011risk corporate customer from China to Japan, exceeding the S$1,500 cross\u2011border wire transfer threshold. While basic CDD was completed, the bank failed to perform the required Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for a high\u2011risk customer, violating clauses 4, 6.3, 6.19\u201126, and 8. The wire transfer meets Travel Rule requirements, but the missing EDD constitutes a significant compliance breach, warranting a high\u2011risk label.",
