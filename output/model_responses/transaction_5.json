  "explanation": "The transaction involves a high\u2011risk corporate customer from China to Japan with a cash deposit of CNY\u202f6,267.57. The bank\u2019s risk assessment requires enhanced due diligence (EDD) for high\u2011risk customers, yet EDD was not performed. Sanctions screening was not conducted, and the customer\u2019s KYC was overdue (due date 7/10/2023). These breaches of clauses 4, 6.3, 6.19\u20116.26, 6.39\u20116.42, and 8 constitute significant AML/CFT compliance failures, warranting a high\u2011risk classification.",
