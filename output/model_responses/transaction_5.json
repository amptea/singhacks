  "explanation": "The transaction amount (CHF 1,991,250.25) exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold, triggering the \"High Transaction Amount\" rule. No other red\u2011flag rules are triggered: the customer risk rating is medium, sanctions screening returned none, EDD is not required, daily cash total is zero, and travel rule data is complete. While the large amount alone raises concern, the absence of additional risk factors suggests a medium overall risk."
