  "explanation": "The transaction meets most AML/CFT requirements: appropriate CDD, EDD, travel\u2011rule compliance, and no structuring. However, the customer\u2019s KYC was last completed on 20/10/2023, which is more than 12 months before the booking date (03/12/2024), exceeding the acceptable period for a low\u2011risk customer. Additionally, sanctions screening returned a potential hit, indicating a possible sanctions violation that warrants heightened scrutiny. No other rule violations were identified, so the overall risk is assessed as medium.",
