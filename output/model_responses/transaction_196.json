  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold, which is a common red flag. However, the customer has a low risk rating, no sanctions hit, EDD is not required, daily cash total is negligible, and travel\u2011rule data is complete. These mitigating factors reduce the overall risk to a medium level."
