    "High Transaction Amount"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction amount (1,853,295.63\u202fJPY) exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold, triggering the \"High Transaction Amount\" rule. However, the customer has a low risk rating, no sanctions hit, EDD is not required, daily cash total is negligible, and travel\u2011rule data is complete. These mitigating factors reduce the overall risk, leading to a medium risk assessment."
