  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both strong indicators of money\u2011laundering risk. Other controls (KYC, EDD, travel rule, daily cash total) are satisfied, but the combination of a large amount and sanctions concern warrants a high\u2011risk classification."
