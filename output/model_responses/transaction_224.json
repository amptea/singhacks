  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both of which are significant red flags. However, other controls are in place: the customer is a corporate entity with a medium risk rating, KYC is current, travel\u2011rule data is complete, and no daily structuring or EDD gaps are present. These mitigating factors moderate the overall risk to a medium level."
