    "Potential Sanctions Hit"
  ],
  "explanation": "The transaction triggered a potential sanctions screening hit, which is a significant red flag. However, the amount is modest, the customer is rated medium risk, daily cash totals are low, and all other controls (travel rule, EDD, etc.) are satisfied. Therefore the overall risk is assessed as medium."
