  "explanation": "The transaction involves a high\u2011risk customer for whom enhanced due diligence (EDD) is required but was not performed. The KYC was last completed over two years ago, and sanctions screening returned a potential hit. The cross\u2011border wire transfer failed to complete the Travel Rule, and the customer was processed under simplified CDD despite a high risk rating. These multiple breaches of MAS Notice 626 clauses indicate a high likelihood of money\u2011laundering risk.",
