  "explanation": "The transaction involves a high\u2011risk customer (high risk rating, originating from JP to TH) and a large wire transfer of HKD\u202f439,477.04. EDD was required but not performed, the travel rule was incomplete for a cross\u2011border wire transfer, simplified CDD was applied to a high\u2011risk customer, no documented risk assessment exists for the complex product channel, and the last KYC was completed almost three years ago. These multiple violations trigger a high\u2011risk assessment with a score of 100.",
