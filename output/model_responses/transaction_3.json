  "explanation": "The transaction is a large cross‑border fund subscription from a Russian domiciliary company, with a potential sanctions hit flagged in the screening. The bank proceeded with the transaction without recording a suspicion determination date and failed to file a suspicious transaction report, violating the requirements of Clause 6.2 and Clause 14. Additionally, the sanctions screening result indicates a potential hit, which under Clause 6.39‑6.42 requires further action. These violations, combined with the high transaction amount and high‑risk jurisdiction, classify the transaction as high risk.",
