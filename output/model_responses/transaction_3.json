  "explanation": "The transaction involves a high\u2011risk jurisdiction (Russia) and a medium\u2011risk customer, yet the risk assessment indicates that enhanced due diligence (EDD) was not required (edd_required=false) despite the high\u2011risk country, constituting a violation of Clause\u202f4. Additionally, the product is marked as complex (product_complex=true) but there is no evidence of a prior risk assessment for the new product, violating Clause\u202f5. No other AML/CFT clauses are breached, so the overall risk is assessed as medium.",
