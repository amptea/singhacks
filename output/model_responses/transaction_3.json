  "explanation": "The transaction involves a high\u2011risk jurisdiction (Russia) and a medium\u2011risk customer, yet the risk assessment indicates that Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) was not required (edd_required=false). Under MAS Notice 626, high\u2011risk jurisdictions mandate EDD, so this is a compliance violation. No other clauses (e.g., sanctions screening, travel rule, or suspicious activity) are breached. The single violation places the transaction in the medium\u2011risk category with a score of 55.",
