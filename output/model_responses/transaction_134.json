  "explanation": "The transaction exceeds the high\u2011amount threshold and triggered a potential sanctions hit, both of which are significant red flags. However, the customer has a low risk rating, EDD was performed, travel rule information is complete, and the daily cash total is negligible. These mitigating factors reduce the overall risk to a medium level."
